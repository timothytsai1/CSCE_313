It took 22.13 seconds in order to transfer a 100Mb file, and I believe that the main bottleneck 
when transferring large files is the amount of round trip server calls that need to be made due 
to the smaller buffer size. Each chunk requires a separate request and response, which increases 
network and processing latency. Additionally, the limits of disk read/write speed further slow down 
the process when handling larger files.
